# Public GitHub Repository

To facilitate sharing this open-source project, we will push the latest code
upon each production deploy to [the public GitHub repository](https://github.com/Open-Science-Online-Grocery/online-grocery).

To do this, ask Andrea or Adam to add you as a collaborator on the project using
your GitHub (not GitLab!) account.

Then, run this command in the terminal:

```
git remote add origin-public https://github.com/Open-Science-Online-Grocery/online-grocery.git
```

You can push the master branch to this remote with: `git push origin-public master`.
